# Banner 3D module

Banner 3D is a simple module that allows the user to convert regular text to special 'banner 3D' text.

The text can have a different background and foreground color.

NOTE: the converted text may be to big for your screen, if so, zoom out in the terminal. 

also, the module currently does NOT support 'other' symbols, like @, #, $, %, ^, and &. 

The module can be installed with the setup.py provided, but be sure to do colorize.py first. Otherwise, the banner3D setup.py will throw an error.

## Dependencies:

banner_3d.py:

- colorize.py
